    <h2>Expectations and their management</h2>
    <p class="blog-date">April 6th, 2024</p>
    <p>My psych doc a month back said I should be careful that I'm not overshooting. Temper my expectations and consider my limits and more yogic bullshit. I have never wanted to end it all more, but in the month since that it has been ringing in my head. What if I just genuinely suck and under the attention issues and the thoughts I am still the same person.
    </p>
    <p>Anyways, wrote this on the day I set up the blog section for this website(?) so hopefully something will push me to interact with some form of code.</p>
