    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have way too many monikers online so depending on where you followed me here from the name may change. All of them are me, in a way.</p>
    <p>So Hi, it's me. I write poorly structured C code, even worse Rust, and so on for asm, c++, python... I also write malware on odd days and read windows documentation in the time left.</p>
    <p>There's no real purpose to adding to the noise of the web with this, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">seo</a> has driven me so mad I could not hold out any longer on making one of these that doesn't make me want to become a hermit.</p>
